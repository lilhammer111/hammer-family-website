                        and there I found my Jojo.

                        romance,

                        Jojo, a true Aquarius and not very tall, caught my eye with her spunky demeanor and stylish
                        short hair. She's
                        not just my wife but my dream come trueâ€”my ideal in every sense.

                        To my dream wife, Jojo: Thank you for being my heart's rhythm and the love of my life.
                        Here's to continuing
                        our
                        dance together through life, perfectly in sync and better with every step.
